# LayerZero Airdrop â€“ Sybil Addresses Report

This file contains a list of Ethereum addresses identified as **Sybil participants** in the LayerZero airdrop. These addresses were flagged and excluded from rewards due to suspected manipulation or abuse of the airdrop eligibility criteria.

## About the LayerZero Airdrop

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/), a cross-chain messaging protocol, conducted a [large airdrop campaign](https://dune.com/oladee/layerzero-airdrop-claim-stats) in **June 2024**

## Sybil Detection Process

To preserve the integrity of the airdrop and prevent Sybil attackers from unfairly claiming rewards, the **LayerZero Foundation** employed a **multi-layered, rigorous detection framework**, which included:

### Technical and Analytical Methods

- **Louvain Community Detection Algorithm**: Used to identify clusters of addresses likely controlled by the same actor
- **Outsourced Expert Analysis**: Detection was supported by [Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai/) and [Chaos Labs](https://www.chaoslabs.xyz/)
- **Self-Reporting Bounty**: Users could voluntarily disclose Sybil activity for a reduced penalty
- **Crowd-Sourced Challenge**: The public was incentivized to identify Sybil clusters, enhancing coverage


## File Description
